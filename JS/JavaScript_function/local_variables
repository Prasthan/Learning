Note: 
    - Variables declared within a JS function, become LOCAL to the function.
    - Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
    Example:

        // code here can NOT use carName

        function myFunction() {
            var carName = "Audi";
            // code here CAN use carName
        }

        // code here can NOT use carName

    - Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different
      functions.
    - Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.
