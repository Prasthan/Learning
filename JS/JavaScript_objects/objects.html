<!--
    - In real life, a car is an object.
    - A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop.
    - All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.
    - All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.
    - Example:
            var car = {type:"Audi", model:"500", color:"white"};

    - The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value seperated by a colon).
    - JavaScript objects are containers for name and values called properties or methods.
-->

<!--
    - Objects can also have methods.
    - Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
    - Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.
    Note: A method is a function stored as a property.
