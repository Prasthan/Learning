	git add .
	git commit -m "message"

# If the remote origin already exists, i.e. you have already set it before:

		git remote -v
	
	ii) If you want to remove current origin:
		git remote rm origin

1. git config --list    [shows the users]

				[to merge into branch, first we have to go to that branch by "git checkout branchname"]

10. to delete branch:
	git branch -d branchname    [from lowercase d, we cannot delete unmerged branch]
	git branch -D branchname    [but from uppercase D, we can delete unmerged branch]
